# Personal Blog to post about what I learn day to day.

# This project is still in progress, I'm looking forward any suggestion for improvment.

## Fell free to run this project on your own:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rizialdi/Blog.git
cd Blog/
```
Then run **yarn ** to install all the necessary modules and run node server:
```bash
yarn
node server.js
```

Go to [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000/) to get a visual understanding.
